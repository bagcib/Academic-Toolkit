We're creating an RCOS android development group that will develop
several applications for google's gnu/linux based mobile platform.
We've chosen android because it closely aligns itself with the open
source community and is relatively new allowing better market
penetration for our applications.

Currently we have three ideas:
1. An 'Academic Toolkit' that will provide the following...
-Grade tracking for multiple classes.
-Computes average based on guidelines set by professors.
-Updates average when new grades are added.
-Provides user with graphs showing averages for different
assignment types, as well as current average throughout the semester.
-Ability to compute GPA for current semester.
-Alert students when their average falls below a predetermined
amount.
-Computes grade needed on certain assignments for user to maintain
their current letter grade, or improve it.
2. A college text book selling/buying application that eliminates the
middleman. (This application will likely be mobile web)
3. A college car pool application to help students find rides within
their university. (This applicaiton will likely be mobile web)

We're going to start with the Academic Toolkit application because
it's lack of network features will make it easier for us to learn the
characteristics of android and get an application to market.

Right now we're just writing the logic/math handling for the application,
once completed we'll conform it to android and work on the interface.

We're modifying a class from a previous RCOS project, but not the gui from that
project because it doesn't suit our needs.
